    <h1>Competitive Mini Game </h1>
    
   <p>
    For my CPE 301L Microcontroller Systems Design final project, I implemented an 
    2-player competitive mini game that resembles the arcade game called Cyclone.
    An LED moved back and forth between 7 LEDs, and the player has to press their 
    designated button when the middle LED is lit up to score a point. The goal of 
    the game is to get to 5 points before the other player.

    This project uses a timer to have the LEDs light up one after the other,
    interrupts for then the players press their buttons, and USART communication to 
    output the players' scores to the serial monitor.
