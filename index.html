    <h2> About Me </h2>
      <p> I recently graduated from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas with a 
        <a href="/Files/Diploma-YanaiAvila.pdf" target="_blank"> B.S. in Computer Engineering </a>.
        It took a bit of figuring things out to get to this point in my life, but here we are.
      
        <br/><br/>
        I was born and raised in Las Vegas, NV. I played the guitar and vihuela for 7 years of my
        life in both my middle school and high school Mariachi groups. Towards the end of high shool, 
        I decided to join the robotics team and that is when I realized that I was meant to be an engineer 
        instead of doing music for the rest of my life. And so I chose engineering. I quickly learned that 
        I love the problem solving part of engineering. I like figuring things out and tinkering. I 
        tried my best to take classes that were very hands on in college, and circuits, IOT, embedded 
        systems, and robotics were among my favorites.
