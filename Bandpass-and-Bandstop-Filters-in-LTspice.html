    <h1> Band-pass and Band-stop Filters in LTspice</h1>
    
   <p>
    For my EE 221 Electronic II final project, 
    I designed and simulated 4 different types of filters using the LTspice simulation software. Filters 
    are circuits designed to pass desired signals and reject others. A band-pass filter passes frequencies
    within a band of frequencies and filters out frequencies outside this band. On the other hand, a band-stop 
    filter rejects frequencies within a band of frequencies and passes the frequencies outside this band. 
    <br/><br/>
    For my band-pass designs I aimed for the them to pass signals within the bandwidth range of 2,000Hz and 8,000Hz 
    and filter out the signals that are not within this range. 
    
    For my band-stop design I aimed for them to filter out signals within the bandwidth range of 200Hz and 800Hz and 
    pass signals that are not within this range.

    I accomplished the project goals by combining two types of filters together: the high-pass filter and the low-pass filter.
