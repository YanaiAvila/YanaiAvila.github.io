        <h2>Band-pass and Band-stop Filters in LTspice</h2>

          <p>
            <b> Course: </b> Circuits II </br>
            <b> Software</b> LTspice </br>
            <b> Project Description: </b> For EE221 final project, 
            I designed and simulated 4 different types of filters using the LTspice simulation software. Filters 
            are circuits designed to pass desired signals and reject others. A band-pass filter passes frequencies
            within a band of frequencies and filters out frequencies outside this band. On the other hand, a band-stop 
            filter rejects frequencies within a band of frequencies and passes the frequencies outside this band. 
            <br/><br/>
            For my band-pass designs I aimed for the them to pass signals within the bandwidth range of 2,000Hz and 8,000Hz 
            and filter out the signals that are not within this range. 
            
            For my band-stop design I aimed for them to filter out signals within the bandwidth range of 200Hz and 800Hz and 
            pass signals that are not within this range.
        
            I accomplished the project goals by combining two types of filters together: the high-pass filter and the low-pass filter.
